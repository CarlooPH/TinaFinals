             <h2>Characteristics</h2>
             <p>God gives us the knowledge to influence others and lead them along the right path, thus I view myself as brave and independent since I am aware that I am capable of doing things that others are also capable of doing. I do think we should occasionally rely on ourselves instead of others, on our own abilities, power, and expertise. We should have a broad perspective in order to appreciate the beauty of every person, both inside and out.<br><br><br>both Aphrodite and I are goddesses of beauty and sensuality, people frequently compare me to her. Although I'm not Cinderella, I do have a good heart and good intentions. I love animals like Snowhite, my heart is warm like Anna, and I always go above and beyond to protect the people I care about, just like Elsa.</p>
